        <h5>Introduction to Input Grammar Fuzzing</h5>
        Fuzzing can be made much more efficient if one knows the language of
        the program input. Based on the fuzzing book (fuzzingbook.org), we
        introduce simple means to specify complex input languages as
        grammars, and using grammar-based fuzzers for effective blackbox
        testing of programs with complex inputs such as JSON, XML, or SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>Input Grammar Fuzzing - Hands-On</h5>
        In this session, you build a grammar-based fuzzer yourself. More
        precisely, you create a SQL grammar that you will feed into a fuzzer
        to test SQL interpreters. Who will be the participant with the
        highest coverage? We also discuss important and common optimizations
        and extensions such as language coverage and probabilistic grammar
        testing. Basic knowledge of Python is required for coding.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5>Input Grammar Fuzzing - Outlook</h5>
        This last session collects and summarizes your experiences and gives some outlooks into more advanced techniques
        such as using constraints to further shape inputs, or coverage-driven greybox grammar fuzzing, looking forward
        to further topics discussed in the workshop.

            The course will discuss the recent advances in criteria-based testing, such as coverage-based
            mutation-based, applied for unit and functional testing. It will then aim discuss the role of automated
            testing during software evolution and maintenance, discussing the key issues arising when performing
            regression testing in continuous integration testing environments, such as test maintenance, test
            selection/prioritization and flakiness.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            Bugs in software can cause serious economic and health
            damage, in particular in software that controls critical
            systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lightweight techniques such as static typing and program
            analysis help to avoid many common bugs, but cannot guarantee
            correctness. To do that, a mathematical proof of program
            correctness is required. However, pen-and-paper proofs,
            inparticular about software, are error-prone. Here, interactive
            theorem provers can help: they are software tools to check
            proofs for correctness. They also come with powerful tools to help the user find (correct) proofs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this lecture, we will give a hands-on introduction to the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL, and
            apply it to verify (simple) programs. We will conclude with an overview of the state-of-the-art and an
            outlook to future research in this area.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            In this course we will show how to approach some security problems in a rigorous and principled way, using
            programming language theory. Some of the problems we will tackle are: reasoning about interaction with
            polynomial adversaries, relating highly optimized implementations with their corresponding specifications,
            and analyzing secret and public data flow of a program. Our case study will be Jasmin, a language designed
            to implement high assurance high speed cryptography. Jasmin provides a detailed control of the assembly
            generated by the compiler, allowing for maximal optimization of cryptographic routines. The compiler is
            verified in Coq, guaranteeing that a Jasmin program and its compilation have equivalent behaviors. From a
            Jasmin program, one may extract a model for the EasyCrypt proof assistant, which may be used to prove
            program properties such as cryptographic security. Additionally, Jasmin provides a safety checker to detect
            common mistakes such as out-of-bounds accesses and arithmetic errors. Finally, we will show a type system
            that allows to compute the public and private information flow of a program, and how such information can be
            used to guarantee that a program does not reveal secret information, even in the presence of side channels
            and speculative execution.
